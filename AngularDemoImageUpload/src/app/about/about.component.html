                <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Schemes for Farmer</strong></p><br />
                <p style="text-align: left;">&bull;     The Farmer Scheme application contains various schemes for farmers, but due to lack of awareness and miscommunication, farmers do not avail these benefits. Hence, we try to integrate some of the schemes like Fasal Bima Yojna and Bidding of Crops scheme.We are implementing a system which is automated and helps to reduce the burden on farmers as well as the system. We are providing an online means to apply and claim insurance which will help the system to work efficiently and enhance smooth handling of records.</p><br /><br />

The premium rates to be paid by farmers are very low and balance premium will be paid by the Government to provide full insured amount to the farmers against crop loss on account of natural calamities.</p><br /><br />
                <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Bidding Process</strong></p><br />
                <p style="text-align: left;">The bidding module will enable the farmer to place crops for auction and receive best price from auction which stabilizes the farmer&rsquo;s income as well as eliminates the stress of physical sale of crops in the market. This will help the farmer to make use of technology and reduce the efforts for selling the crops.</p>
